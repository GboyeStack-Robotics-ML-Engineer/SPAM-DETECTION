## **Usage**  
1. **Prepare Your Data**  
   - Upload a labeled dataset in CSV format. Ensure it contains message texts and corresponding labels.  

2. **Run the Streamlit App**  
   - Launch the app for training and inference:  
     ```bash
     streamlit run Main.py
     ```
   - Use the app to configure hyperparameters, monitor training progress, and evaluate results.

3. **Train the Model**  
   - Use the app to train the model with your dataset, fine-tune hyperparameters, and observe performance metrics.  

4. **Model Inference**  
   - Test the trained model using sample inputs to predict spam or legitimate messages.
